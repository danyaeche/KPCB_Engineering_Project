# KPCB_Engineering_Project
Engineering Project for KPCB 

This is the Engineering Project for KPCB fellows application. I am building a soltaire game 
that runs on the console. 

I wrote an quasi-complete version of solitaire

using python 3 and standard libraries. 

I was hospitlized the week on started this application and unfortunately, the week I started the application was October 1st, so essentially the last week to turn it in. However, I did my best and wrote the core classes and methods however I was unable to complete the interface for the solitaire game. Although my code is commented and you can look at the classes.
